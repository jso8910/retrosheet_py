"""
Create a class which creates a database, initializes it with stuff like a lookup table for team names and ids (so FLO gets an id of something like 27 or whatever and MIA also gets 27 or whatever)
Should also have a function where you pass a dictionary or something of a game (whatever format i decide to make it in) and it puts it into the DB with all relevant info
Maybe also create player stats or something based on this game data, but that might be a bit complex

Probably use a file to create all the schemas
Use mysql probably
Also put all player ids along with their names here, https://www.retrosheet.org/BIOFILE.TXT

Also init any enums I use
